  During the final weeks of her life, all spent in an Indian hospital, my
  grandmother deteriorated peacefully, and gracefully, until she slipped into a
  coma and breathed her last. My 10-year-old self remembers a thing or two about
  this time. The hospital's egg curry, a much-loved north Indian dish, was
  amazing.
