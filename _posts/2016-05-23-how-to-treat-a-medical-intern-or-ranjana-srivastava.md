description: "When I was an emergency department intern, the consultant asked me to start assessing a patient in the critical bay. There, I found an elderly man who had clearly suffered a stroke. He couldn't speak. Sensing another presence in the room, I turned around to find a stately man patiently watching my futile attempts to elicit a reflex on the patient."
