Ethically Influencing Referrals in ACOs 

viders outside the ACO without patient or physician penalties. 

Some physician or patient pref- erences might well conflict with an ACO's cost and quality goals. Such tensions may be irresolv- able, but the organization could mitigate them by engaging physi- cians and patients in the process of choosing metrics for preferred providers, which could improve patient-centered care, ensure buy-in, and engender trust in the ACO. Engaging the wider provider community in the process could help ensure their buy-in, clarify- ing expectations and increasing their commitment to the goals of measuring and encouraging high- value referrals. 

Finally, there's the question of whether and how to incentivize physicians and patients to use and follow new referral practices. Influencing the process financial- ly, by paying physicians bonuses or promising them a portion of the ACO's shared savings, may be controversial and might re- kindle the concerns about finan- cial gatekeeping that plagued managed care. But financial in- centives are not the only way to influence behavior.5 A more ethi- cal approach might be to provide physicians and patients with data on specialists' performance on the relevant metrics, perhaps in the form of a point-of-care deci- sion aid, and allow them to joint- ly determine the best course of 

action; their mutual interest in choosing high-value care may be incentive enough for engaging in the desired referral practices. 

If information alone proves in- sufficient but physicians and pa- tients retain control over referral decisions, additional incentives may be necessary to influence re- ferrals. Nonfinancial incentives, such as organizational recogni- tion of "high-value referrers," may be a logical next step. If that approach is ineffective, carefully applied financial incentives, such as bonuses linked to high-value referral practices, may be neces- sary. For the use of such incen- tives to be ethical, however, pa- tients must be informed of their existence, both by the ACO and by the referring physician.4 What- ever incentives are used, patients' best interests should remain pri- mary, and the incentives should not inappropriately influence med- ical decision making. 

If ACOs influence referral pat- terns in the right way, they could ensure the provision of high-value care. And influencing referrals by helping patients knowingly and intentionally choose the most ap- propriate physicians could actu- ally be more respectful of patient choice and physicians' duty of fi- delity than current referral prac- tices are. 

Whether the approach we en- vision is feasible in all circum- stances remains to be seen, but 

we believe that ethical consider- ations should guide referral prac- tices. Research is needed to elu- cidate ACOs' current referral practices and their conformity to and effects on core ethical val- ues. As health care organizations assume increasing financial risk, the need to influence referrals will probably grow, and today's ACOs have an opportunity to de- velop and disseminate models for doing so ethically.

On the Death of a Colleague Ranjana Srivastava, F.R.A.C.P. 

One morning, out of the blue, my close friend, colleague, and mentor has chest pain and collapses on his way to the hos- 

pital to begin rounds. A large team of doctors, our friends and colleagues, work desperately for many hours trying to save him, 

but it is not to be. He dies young. 

Many years ago, when I be- came his fellow, I was surprised

that my prominent new boss had noticed me when I was a mere intern on hectic ward rounds. This ability to take note of all kinds of people may be his most impressive legacy, and during the days after his death, all kinds of people who knew him experience acute emotional trauma. Doctors hover on the ward, dumbfound- ed, pretending to be busy. Two witnesses to the event take hesi- tant steps toward one another then suddenly peel away in dif- ferent directions, consternation written on their faces. Current and former fellows, residents, and students wander the corri- dors as if they've lost their bear- ings. Straining to do my job, I marvel that in a hospital that routinely and efficiently deals with life, death, and all the in- tervening drama, the passing of our colleague has shattered the established structure for coping with loss. 

The memorial service is stand- ing room only. It's hard to be- lieve that the man who usually held command on such stages is gone. Colleagues speak of him eloquently and magnanimously. Former patients pay homage to a man who saved their lives. As the eulogies flow, his family sits quietly, absorbing the overwhelm- ing sense that their personal sacrifice so affected the wider world. 

Practicalities are attended to. Gaps in rosters are filled, confer- ences and presentations recon- figured or canceled. A debriefing session is held, but many people don't go, feeling that it's prema- ture. His family makes the oner- ous trip to his office to retrieve his personal belongings. 

A week goes by and then four, six, eight. And yet it feels like the 

tumult has just begun. On the ward, flicking through his neat and considered entries in patients' records, I miss him. A woman says, "When my husband was intubated, most of the doctors didn't say much, but he would al- ways pull up a chair and talk to me about how I was coping." 

A nurse approaches, cradling a thick memorial book that is still being filled. Quietly, she asks me how the family is doing. "I keep wondering about his chil- dren," she says. I'm considering how much I should share with her when she sighs, "I'd better get back to work." She pulls away reluctantly, and I realize that she has far more to say and our shifts may not coincide again. I feel as if his absence has created a deep crater. And I can't help but wonder why. 

As an oncologist, I reconcile myself to frequent losses of pa- tients. Yet the loss of a colleague somehow feels like a larger, more grievous, more unjust betrayal. On the ward, a patient who is re- lieved after 3 days of nagging central chest pain from a myo- cardial infarct that he ignored while playing golf triggers in me a faint resentment. When my fa- vorite 90-year-old patient with metastatic cancer and myriad se- rious medical problems breezes in on her walker and announces that she feels "perfect," I feel small at my inability to share her happiness as I usually would. I watch, recoiling from my own reactions, discomfited by the evaporation of my empathy in the face of personal loss. These unbidden, emotional, human re- actions --- in place of the mea- sured, rational, doctorly ones I wish to have --- cause me to question my morality and hence, 

paradoxically, make it difficult to discuss this death as openly as I might the death of a long-time patient. 

I gather from e-mails and so- cial media pages that the well of sadness runs deep and my expe- rience is not singular. But I keep hoping to hear others say that as they're going about their day, seeing patients, conferring with colleagues, signing prescriptions, they, too, are sometimes rendered breathless by a wave of heart- ache. Such an admission would let me know that it's OK to feel sad beyond the expected period of mourning. As it is, I fear that everyone else "gets it," that I'm the only one with a maladaptive response to loss, somehow too slack or unaware to know I must move on more quickly. There seems to be an expiration date to grieving, a point when it becomes tedious to others. 

One day, as I stare at the last e-mail I'd received from my friend before his death, in which he'd suggested we meet to discuss a joint project, my reverie is broken by a knock on the door. 

"I'm really sorry to trouble you," the medical student says. 

"Please come in," I say, glad for the company. Medical stu- dents with an intact sense of wonder are one of the best things about teaching hospitals. Pulling up a chair, she spends a moment of indecisiveness. Then she asks directly, 

"Do you miss him?'" Expecting to discuss a late as- 

signment or a career dilemma, I find myself speechless. 

"Do you sometimes think he is going to just walk through the doors?" she goes on. 

"Well, that's wishful think- ing," I wince, surprised at how

irked and pained I am by an in- nocent question. 

She seems contrite, perhaps a little embarrassed. 

"I'm sorry," I say. "I miss him deeply, and I know what you mean about his walking back in. It all feels new to me." 

I watch her eyes grow moist. "The other students are saying 

I must get over it or I'll never be- come a real doctor. They say real doctors don't cry. This has forced me to think about what specialty I might pursue where I don't have to deal with loss." 

I stare at her incredulously. Fighting back tears, she ven- 

tures, "Do you think I should see a 

psychiatrist?" "What for?" "To learn how to experience 

loss properly. I really want to be a good doctor," she says. "I want to be strong to help others." 

My incredulity is replaced by alarm that we impart such perni- cious messages to impression- able future doctors. When I've managed to collect my thoughts, I explain that colleagues with 

whom we train and practice for decades can become akin to, or even closer than, family. Indeed, our colleagues understand our aspirations, successes, and frus- trations better than any outsider. Standing alongside them, we form a shield against the tides of misfortune that strike our pa- tients. So when one of our own is snatched from our midst, the experience threatens our very no- tion of who we are and what we do. It jarringly reminds us of our own mortality when a respected colleague who has saved lives is rendered impotent against his own fallibility. It somehow doesn't make sense to us. 

The student and I recall an elderly patient whose family was exasperated at his inability to overcome the loss of his only sis- ter some months previously. The patient came to us, reluctantly seeking a cure for his sadness, which he perceptively remarked was not interfering with any- thing other than his family's ex- pectations regarding a suitable mourning period. We told him that the journey from grief to ac- 

ceptance was not a quick ride but a voyage with winding turns, patchy progress, and inevitable setbacks. Reassured that he wasn't losing his mind, he went home, consoled that at least his doctors understood. 

Gradually, the student relaxes and seems more willing to be- lieve that the arc of grief rehab can be long and tenuous. "It might even help me appreciate the losses my patients endure," she says. 

"That's a good way to be a real doctor," I agree. 

As she leaves, my computer flashes a reminder to respond to my friend's final e-mail. A coil of grief constricts my heart. But this time I resist becoming im- patient with myself. "Weeks on, we still miss you," I write. Then I hit "send."
