            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Making patients feel dumb is a treatment all doctors should eschew | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>"Just because I have cancer they think I am dumb."

She was in hospital with an infection that was proving more resolute than I'd thought.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d2ec70791bd3dc8579de77cca883aec1/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fmedia%2Feecee35d5614c670e4e6c927debf4d34638d4da6%2F0_0_5616_3370%2F5616.jpg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3D02f86c51be7f34312d6f3de5a5ce6aeb"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>STRESS AND CANCER</h1><p>Every day in Australia 360 people learn they have cancer. It goes without saying it's a very stressful time. Stress as a cause of cancer has not been convincingly proven but recently researchers have been looking at how stress drives the spread of an existing cancer from the original tumour.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/302c295ccc3f3ed43167497d950059b6/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=285&cropwidth=480&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2FCWg90-oOZ3I%2Fhqdefault.jpg&x=0&y=36"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Forcing your child to become a doctor could be your worst parenting decision | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>There I was, almost at the end of the night, having spoken to a few hundred hand-picked, talented high school students about my life as a doctor. Their youth was no barrier to their determination to be the best - I met budding astronauts, focused scientists, concerned environmentalists, and as usual, a horde of kids who dreamed of becoming doctors.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/583acc8822e2a23db13993dba4feaf689594473a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Listening to patients at the end of their lives is crucial - so why don't doctors do it? | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>The new patient is an elderly, diabetic lady whose heart has been teetering on the edge of failure for the past two years. She likes saying that her husband's death broke her heart - it might have been so but at age 80, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension and a series of heart attacks have also taken their toll.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a55ba8de0a605c653cf515d9489f6cace7bf88cb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
