A 32-year-old woman came to the surgeon in search of a nose job, to alter the shape of her nose and fix her sinuses. The surgeon agreed to undertake the cosmetic surgery in a small, private hospital.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7d970ad10ae9fae44a4646e462793629a821635.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Racism is the elephant in the hospital room: it's time we confronted it | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>"Everyone knows I don't like the fucking Chinese!!" she bellows, shattering the quiet hum of the clinic. The doctor holding her file is flummoxed. The horrified secretaries just put their head down and continue working, the patient's obscenities mingling with the ringing phones. All the waiting patients feign an interest in their laps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4259873e526e63a02749bd7e0adadbcd46fed52b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>As my youngest child gets ready to start school, this is my greatest wish | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>Trying on his new uniform, my five-year old son spontaneously recalled a child we met on a trip to Mumbai. "How will she buy a school uniform?" The little girl, her toddler brother in tow, was hawking garlands outside a famous temple. Nearby, her mother urged visitors to buy them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fcc24c2de24279980a8175b5d4cdc4e8a3d4217d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The world regards Australia's healthcare system as one of the best. It's time we realised why | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>It was nearing a weekend when I inherited the care of a distressed elderly man. The hospital bed had been pushed against the wall to guard against falls. His hair was plastered in sweat and his limbs jerked involuntarily as he mumbled incoherently.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fc2349e7106fc9778ca9a4dc91ece57da31c6c72.jpg"></article>]]></description>
