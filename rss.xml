            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>When medical hierarchy and surgeons' egos compete with patients' best interests | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>Once upon a time in Sydney there was a plastic surgeon and an anaesthetist. A 32-year-old woman came to the surgeon in search of a nose job, to alter the shape of her nose and fix her sinuses. The surgeon agreed to undertake the cosmetic surgery in a small, private hospital.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7d970ad10ae9fae44a4646e462793629a821635.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What do doctors say to 'alternative therapists' when a patient dies? Nothing. We never talk | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>The consultation is over and I stand to escort her out. Through the open door, I notice the waiting row of patients staring drearily at the television. "But I am not done yet," my patient says plaintively. "I still have questions." She's already extended a 30-minute consult and I'm pushed for time.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b074df1d5f11b4ac978cbebb6daacb838973efbd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Women doctors are underpaid and undervalued. And it's not a mystery why | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>It was a prolonged and delicate operation. The chief surgeon asked the intern to assist. As she leaned forward, the surgeon's elbow brushed against her chest. Under the glare of lights and the tension of surgery, she ignored it, keeping her eye on the job.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/071bf7720d6f043cb6c61bf8862e4ca5414a8cd7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

What's next?</h1><p>"I need to figure this out, I am not sure, I need to think a bit", she says, her voice taking on a pleading quality.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to treat a medical intern | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>When I was an emergency department intern, the consultant asked me to start assessing a patient in the critical bay. There, I found an elderly man who had clearly suffered a stroke. He couldn't speak. Sensing another presence in the room, I turned around to find a stately man patiently watching my futile attempts to elicit a reflex on the patient.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/580f139472542817701399560b4edfb22a8b40cb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
