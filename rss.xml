            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>When medical hierarchy and surgeons' egos compete with patients' best interests | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>Once upon a time in Sydney there was a plastic surgeon and an anaesthetist. A 32-year-old woman came to the surgeon in search of a nose job, to alter the shape of her nose and fix her sinuses. The surgeon agreed to undertake the cosmetic surgery in a small, private hospital.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7d970ad10ae9fae44a4646e462793629a821635.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The days of the male Anglo-Saxon doctor are truly over</h1><p>THE consultation has been going pleasantly until I politely decline to renew a cancer patient's blood pressure pills. She stores them in expired medicine containers with mismatched labels. Alarmed at the risky behaviour, I encourage her to visit her GP. ''He is useless,'' grunts her son.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e52aecaa8108045439a5d91b0286bc7f99337d49.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How doctors treat doctors may be medicine's secret shame | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>My friend is a respected oncologist at a prestigious American cancer centre where international patients come to seek his expertise. It's uncommon for him to ask my counsel but I can tell he is troubled. Under his care in hospital is a young patient, the daughter of influential parents, diagnosed with incurable cancer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c195f235dbd6b3d916dd2fa2dbd88cb41f775841.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What do doctors say to 'alternative therapists' when a patient dies? Nothing. We never talk | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>The consultation is over and I stand to escort her out. Through the open door, I notice the waiting row of patients staring drearily at the television. "But I am not done yet," my patient says plaintively. "I still have questions." She's already extended a 30-minute consult and I'm pushed for time.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b074df1d5f11b4ac978cbebb6daacb838973efbd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Women doctors are underpaid and undervalued. And it's not a mystery why | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>It was a prolonged and delicate operation. The chief surgeon asked the intern to assist. As she leaned forward, the surgeon's elbow brushed against her chest. Under the glare of lights and the tension of surgery, she ignored it, keeping her eye on the job.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/071bf7720d6f043cb6c61bf8862e4ca5414a8cd7.jpg"></article>]]></description>
