A 32-year-old woman came to the surgeon in search of a nose job, to alter the shape of her nose and fix her sinuses.

A woman who wants to see an alternative healer asks: ''What have I got to lose anyway?'' She has newly diagnosed cancer and while discussing chemotherapy, she expresses her very real concerns of toxicity; I reassure her that though it will not be an easy road, she will have care that is comparable with the best in the world.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f9679495a064d8d6caf9fab394d8aba7afd5bd10.jpg"></article>]]></description>
