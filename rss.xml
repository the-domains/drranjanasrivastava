            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>When medical hierarchy and surgeons' egos compete with patients' best interests | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>Once upon a time in Sydney there was a plastic surgeon and an anaesthetist. A 32-year-old woman came to the surgeon in search of a nose job, to alter the shape of her nose and fix her sinuses. The surgeon agreed to undertake the cosmetic surgery in a small, private hospital.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7d970ad10ae9fae44a4646e462793629a821635.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Question Time: Compassionate Healthcare</h1><p>Medical professionals and patients agree, on the whole, that our healthcare system should be compassionate and patient-focused - but whether we're meeting our own standards is a whole other question. In this discussion, we'll explore the idea of compassionate healthcare, and consider whether we're meeting the mark in Australia today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4509cc49182803c79742efb9f1e7e9643ba4f1b1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How do you tell your children you have cancer?</h1><p>"Make sure you put in some advice about how to tell the kids," a colleague urged me. My first response was: "I don't know if I can. It's such a difficult topic." "You have to," she insisted. "You know how much our patients struggle with this. I know Karen does."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/34d9eb83452de1f65c35ca68a714697e3c97eb05.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Doctors as an arm of border protection? That's a step too far | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>My phone beeps with a text message on a frantic day in clinic. It's from a surgeon who wants me to call him. "I'm in a quandary," he says outright. A patient has been under his care for days. She arrived at a large public hospital suffering from a life-threatening condition which required surgery.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/619842bb1e6ece107b8439b0547a152cc7221fc1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Racism is the elephant in the hospital room: it's time we confronted it | Ranjana Srivastava</h1><p>"Everyone knows I don't like the fucking Chinese!!" she bellows, shattering the quiet hum of the clinic. The doctor holding her file is flummoxed. The horrified secretaries just put their head down and continue working, the patient's obscenities mingling with the ringing phones. All the waiting patients feign an interest in their laps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4259873e526e63a02749bd7e0adadbcd46fed52b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

"How will she buy a school uniform?" The little girl, her toddler brother in tow, was hawking garlands outside a famous temple.
